      <p className="leading-7 opacity-90">
        Le Fog is an independent music project crafting immersive, atmospheric soundscapes —
        music that lingers like mist. Slow-moving textures, restrained rhythm, and melodic fragments
        dissolve into memory.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 opacity-90 mt-4">
        The project merges a composer’s ear with a designer’s sensibility: clarity, flow, and
        subtlety over spectacle. Every release is built to be lived with — headphones on,
        eyes closed, world softened.
